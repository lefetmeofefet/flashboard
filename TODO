BACKEND
- save holds and routes to DB instead of local file
- make code look and feel better
    - route class instead of dict
    - specify the request format in each API endpoint instead of just saying its a "dict"
- find out why running uvicorn with reload=False stops the multithreading code from sharing objects??? (specifically when server.py uses wall parameter from wall.py) holy shit

FRONTEND
- add loaders
- make the route editor screen resemble the real wall.
    - use custom shapes instead of circles for holds?
    - use hold images?
    - just put a picture of the wall and overlay it with the buttons?
- think about a better way to turn on / off a route, consider multiple people using the app - gotta display current route
